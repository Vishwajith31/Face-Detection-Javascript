# Face Detection Web Application

This is a web application that performs real-time face detection using the face-api.js library. Users can view live video from their webcam and see face detection, facial landmarks, and facial expressions overlayed on the video stream.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: The application detects faces in real-time using the face-api.js library.
- **Facial Landmarks Detection**: It identifies facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc., providing additional insights into facial features.
- **Facial Expression Recognition**: The application recognizes facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., providing a fun and interactive experience.
- **Webcam Integration**: Users can view live video from their webcam directly in the web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring the web page layout and styling elements.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for implementing interactive features and integrating the face-api.js library.
- **face-api.js**: A JavaScript library for face detection, recognition, and analysis in the browser.
- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**: Used to access the user's webcam stream directly in the browser.
Certainly! Here's a sample README file for your face detection code:

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with support for `navigator.getUserMedia`
- Webcam

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-detection
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

4. Allow access to your webcam when prompted.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the `face-api.js` library for face detection. The library is included in the project, and the necessary models are loaded from the `/models` directory.

## How it Works

1. The script loads the required face detection models using `Promise.all`.
2. The `startVideo` function initiates the webcam stream using `navigator.getUserMedia`.
3. When the video starts playing, a canvas is created to overlay the face detection results.
4. The `setInterval` function continuously detects faces, landmarks, and facial expressions in the video stream.
5. Detected faces are drawn on the canvas along with landmarks and facial expressions.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your needs. You can adjust the video dimensions, styling, or explore additional features provided by `face-api.js`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the webcam access or face detection, make sure your browser supports the required APIs and permissions.
